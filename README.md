# Code First Girls- MySQL Project

## Title - Games R Us

## Description
A MySQL project using Workbench to create and hold a database for the company Games R Us.
The database holds information regarding customers, employees, games, suppliers, inventory and suppliers. Users will be able to complete queries about the type of information in these tables.

Initally to start off with the hardest part of the project was actually to come up with an idea of what I wanted to do because there is so much different ideas and paths that you can go down. This idea of Games R Us came from my children. We are a family of gamers and you can imagine we have loads of different games, sometimes having multiple of certain games as we may want to play at the same time. 

This started me off by making an inventory type database, what games, if there is multiple and who owns it. From there I wanted to further extend the idea and this is where my younger days of 'Blockbuster' came to mind where you was able to buy and rent games and movies. This is how I added employees and suppliers. This will then allow me to query more data and even come up with patterns such as popular games, popular platforms customers play on and what times customers like to buy. 

## Future Implementation
I would like to extend this project further in the future into having a front end, using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I would like to make the database easier to manage for users and be more aesthetically pleasing to the eye. 

## How to run
You will need a program that can run MySQL.
